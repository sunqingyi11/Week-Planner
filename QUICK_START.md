## Key Concepts

### The "Father-Son" System
```
📋 Task in Sidebar (Father)  →  Can be edited
    ↓
📅 Tasks in Calendar (Sons)  →  Auto-update when father changes
```

**Example:**
- Father: "Team Meeting" (in sidebar)
- Son 1: Monday 9 AM (in calendar)
- Son 2: Wednesday 9 AM (in calendar)
- Edit father → Both sons update instantly! ✨

## Quadrants Explained

The app uses the Eisenhower Matrix:

1. **重要不紧急** (Important & Not Urgent)
   - Strategic planning, learning, relationships
   - Schedule these first!

2. **重要紧急** (Important & Urgent)
   - Crises, deadlines, emergencies
   - Do these immediately

3. **不重要但紧急** (Not Important but Urgent)
   - Interruptions, some meetings
   - Delegate if possible

4. **不重要不紧急** (Not Important & Not Urgent)
   - Time wasters, distractions
   - Minimize these

## Pro Tips 💡

1. **Color Coding**: Use colors consistently
   - 🟣 Purple: Work
   - 🟡 Yellow: Personal
   - 🔵 Cyan: Learning
   - 🟢 Green: Health
   - 🟠 Orange: Social
   - 🔴 Red: Urgent

2. **Plan Your Week**: 
   - Sunday evening: Review and schedule
   - Create all tasks in sidebar first
   - Then drag them to calendar slots

3. **Recurring Tasks**:
   - Create once (e.g., "Daily Standup")
   - Drag to Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri
   - Edit once, all instances update!

4. **Quick Edit**:
   - Hover over task → Icons appear
   - Pencil = Edit
   - Trash = Delete

5. **Visual Planning**:
   - Use the calendar to see your week at a glance
   - Identify gaps and optimize your schedule
   - Balance different task types with colors

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Can I edit a task in the calendar?**
A: No, you must edit the task in the left sidebar. Calendar copies will update automatically.

**Q: I deleted a task and all calendar copies disappeared!**
A: That's correct! Deleting the "father" removes all "sons." Right-click individual calendar tasks to remove only those.

**Q: How do I make a task take 1 hour instead of 30 minutes?**
A: Double-click the calendar task to toggle between 30 min and 1 hour.

**Q: My changes aren't saved!**
A: They are! The app saves automatically to your browser's localStorage.

**Q: Can I access this from another device?**
A: Not automatically. Data is stored locally in your browser. Copy the HTML file to use on other devices.
