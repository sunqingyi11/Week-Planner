# Updates - Polish & Refinements

## Summary of Changes

All requested improvements have been successfully implemented! Here's what's new:

---

## 1. ✅ Task Board Fills Screen Height

**What Changed:**
- The Planning section (计划中) now properly fills the available screen height
- Task board scrolls within its container when content overflows
- Layout uses flexbox for proper height distribution

**Technical Details:**
- Left sidebar now uses `h-screen` with proper flex layout
- Planning section has `flex-1` to take available space
- Content area scrolls with `overflow-y-auto`

---

## 2. ✅ Single Accordion Expansion

**What Changed:**
- Only one accordion section can be open at a time
- Clicking a section closes all others automatically
- Clicking an open section closes it

**User Experience:**
- Cleaner interface with focused content
- Prevents information overload
- Better space utilization

**Example:**
1. Open "计划中" → Other sections close
2. Open "本周要务" → "计划中" closes automatically
3. Click "本周要务" again → All sections close

---

## 3. ✅ Drag Tasks Between Sections

**What Changed:**
- Tasks can now be dragged between all three accordion sections:
  - 计划中 (Planning)
  - 本周要务 (This Week)
  - 已完成 (Finished)
- Visual feedback with hover states on section headers
- Blue highlight when hovering over a section with a dragged task

**How It Works:**
1. Click and drag any task
2. Hover over a different section header
3. Header shows blue highlight
4. Drop to move task to that section
5. Toast notification confirms the move

**Visual Feedback:**
- Section header gets light blue background
- Left border appears in blue
- Smooth transitions

## 4. ✅ Smart Calendar Cell Logic

**What Changed:**
- Maximum 2 tasks per calendar cell (30-minute block)
- Dynamic task sizing based on cell occupancy:
  - **1 task** = Full height (36px) - takes entire 30-minute block
  - **2 tasks** = Half height each (16px) - each takes ~15 minutes visually
- Automatic position management
- Prevents overcrowding

**User Experience:**
1. Drag first task → Takes full cell height
2. Drag second task → Both resize to half height
3. Try to drag third task → Shows warning message: "每个时间块最多只能放置2个任务"
4. Tasks stack vertically with proper spacing

**Technical Implementation:**
- Position tracking (0 for first, 1 for second)
- Automatic reordering when tasks are deleted
- Visual hierarchy with proper spacing

**Example:**
```
Before (empty cell):
+------------------+
|                  |
|                  |
+------------------+

After 1 task:
+------------------+
| Task 1 (full)    |
|                  |
+------------------+

After 2 tasks:
+------------------+
| Task 1 (half)    |
+------------------+
| Task 2 (half)    |
+------------------+
```

## 5. ✅ Calendar Row Colors Updated

**What Changed:**
- Updated background colors for calendar grid
- 12 PM row now has correct coloring
- Weekend columns (Sunday, Saturday) use `bg-neutral-50`
- Weekday columns use `bg-white`
- Consistent with Figma design specifications

**Color Scheme:**
- **Weekends (Sun, Sat)**: Light gray (`bg-neutral-50`)
- **Weekdays (Mon-Fri)**: White (`bg-white`)
- **All Hours**: Consistent within each day column

## Additional Improvements

### Better Drag & Drop Handling
- Prevents accidental drags when clicking edit/delete buttons
- Proper cleanup of hover states after drag ends
- Improved visual feedback during drag operations

### Enhanced Section Management
- Tasks render correctly in all three sections
- "本周要务" and "已完成" sections now fully functional
- Each section has proper scrolling when content overflows

### UI Polish
- Smooth transitions on all interactions
- Consistent spacing throughout
- Better visual hierarchy

---

## How to Test

### Test 1: Screen Height
1. Open the app
2. Resize browser window vertically
3. Planning section should always fill available space
4. Content should scroll when overflow occurs

### Test 2: Single Accordion
1. Click "计划中" - opens
2. Click "本周要务" - "计划中" closes, "本周要务" opens
3. Click "本周要务" again - closes
4. Result: Only one section open at a time

### Test 3: Drag Between Sections
1. Create a task in "计划中"
2. Drag task and hover over "本周要务" header
3. Header should show blue highlight
4. Drop task
5. Task moves to "本周要务" section
6. Toast shows: "任务已移至本周要务"

### Test 4: Calendar Cell Limits
1. Drag a task to a calendar cell → Takes full height
2. Drag another task to same cell → Both resize to half height
3. Try dragging a third task to same cell → Warning message appears
4. Drag first or second task out → Remaining task resizes to full height

### Test 5: Calendar Colors
1. Observe Sunday and Saturday columns → Light gray
2. Observe Monday-Friday columns → White
3. Check 12 PM row → Should match weekday/weekend pattern

## Breaking Changes

**None!** All existing functionality remains intact:
- Task creation and editing still work
- Calendar drag & drop from accordion still works
- Father-son relationship preserved
- All data persists in localStorage

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Task Height in Calendar**: With 2 tasks, each shows at 16px (minimal but functional)
2. **Section Scrolling**: "本周要务" and "已完成" have max-height to prevent overflow
3. **No Visual Indicators**: Task count in cells not shown (could be added if needed)

---

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Task Count Badge**: Show number in cell when 2 tasks present
2. **Resize Handle**: Allow manual adjustment of task heights
3. **Overflow Indicator**: Show when more space is needed
4. **Drag Preview**: Better visual during drag operation
5. **Undo/Redo**: For section moves

---

## Technical Notes

### Performance
- Efficient cell lookup using Map
- Minimal re-renders
- Optimized drag event handlers

### Data Structure
```javascript
// Calendar Task now includes position
{
  id: "unique-id",
  taskId: "parent-task-id",
  name: "Task Name",
  color: "violet",
  day: 0-6,
  hour: 0-15,
  half: 0-1,
  position: 0-1  // NEW: 0 for first, 1 for second in cell
}
```

### Browser Compatibility
- Tested in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- All drag & drop features work across browsers
- Flexbox layout fully supported
