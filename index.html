57e427a258a28e94c8262074b41008f82ad64bfd# Polish Update v2.1 - Left Panel Refinements

## All Improvements Completed! ✅

Thank you for the detailed feedback! Here's everything that's been polished:

---

## 1. ✅ Undo Button for "已完成" Section

**What's New:**
- When you drag a task to the "已完成" (Finished) section, a special toast appears
- The toast includes an **"撤销" (Undo)** button
- Click the undo button to instantly restore the task to its previous section
- The undo option is available for 5 seconds

**How It Works:**
1. Drag any task to "已完成" section
2. Toast appears: "任务已移至已完成" with a white **撤销** button
3. Click "撤销" within 5 seconds to undo the move
4. Task returns to its original section (计划中 or 本周要务)

**Visual Design:**
- Toast message on dark background
- White undo button with hover effect
- 5-second window to undo
- Clear confirmation when undone

**Example:**
```
[Toast Notification]
任务已移至已完成 [撤销]
       ↑
   Click to undo
```

## 2. ✅ Task Board Height Fills Screen

**What's Fixed:**
- All three accordion sections now properly fill the vertical screen height
- "计划中" (Planning) - fills remaining space
- "本周要务" (This Week) - fills remaining space when expanded
- "已完成" (Finished) - fills remaining space when expanded

**Technical Implementation:**
- Each section uses flexbox layout
- Content areas have `overflow-y-auto` for scrolling
- Proper space distribution between sections
- Header is fixed height, content fills remaining space

**User Experience:**
- No wasted vertical space
- Smooth scrolling within each section
- Responsive to window resizing
- Always uses full screen height

---

## 3. ✅ "添加任务" Button in 本周要务 Section

**What's New:**
- "本周要务" (This Week) section now has its own "添加任务" button
- Located at the top of the section content
- Same styling as the main "添加任务" button
- Opens the same task creation drawer

**Location:**
- Inside "本周要务" section
- Above the task quadrants
- Always visible when section is expanded

**Button Design:**
- Dark background (`bg-slate-900`)
- White text with plus icon
- Full width of the section
- Hover effect for better UX

---

## 4. ✅ Quadrant Grouping in All Sections

**What's New:**
- "本周要务" (This Week) tasks are now grouped by quadrants
- "已完成" (Finished) tasks are now grouped by quadrants
- Same 4 quadrants in all sections:
  1. 重要不紧急 (Important & Not Urgent)
  2. 重要紧急 (Important & Urgent)
  3. 不重要但紧急 (Not Important but Urgent)
  4. 不重要不紧急 (Not Important & Not Urgent)

**Layout:**
```
本周要务 (5)
├─ [添加任务] Button
├─ 重要不紧急
│  ├─ Task 1
│  └─ Task 2
├─ 重要紧急
│  └─ Task 3
└─ 不重要但紧急
   ├─ Task 4
   └─ Task 5
```

**Benefits:**
- Consistent organization across all sections
- Easy to see task priority distribution
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Better task management

**Visual Design:**
- Quadrant labels in small gray text
- Proper spacing between quadrants
- Tasks grouped with 2px gaps
- Only shows quadrants that have tasks

---

## 5. ✅ Calendar Colors Fixed

**What's Fixed:**
- All calendar row colors now properly follow the design
- Weekend columns (Sunday, Saturday) use light gray (`bg-neutral-50`)
- Weekday columns (Mon-Fri) use white (`bg-white`)
- **12 PM row** now has correct coloring
- Consistent throughout all hours

**Color Logic:**
- Simple and clean: Weekend = gray, Weekday = white
- No special row coloring (previous attempt removed)
- Matches Figma design specifications

**Before vs After:**
```
Before: Complex logic with special cases
After:  Simple logic - weekends gray, weekdays white
```
